# Support

This integration is built as open source which you are free to use and customise for your implementation. Amplience supports this integration for the expected behaviour and roles between the 3 key parts of the integration:

1. Amplience Platform
2. Stylitics Platform
3. Integration Scripts

Support is directly via the [Amplience Support Desk](https://support.amplience.com) as a first line.

## Hosting
The integration libraries are hosted in `npm` for node applications and `unpkg` for javascript use. SLA's and uptime are subject to their SLA's and uptime.

Should you want to host files on your own HTTPS hosting environments, please feel free to do so and update any URL's used.

> Note: We also host some example visualisations in an Amplience S3 bucket. In an implementation we would expect these to point to your application.

## Watch
We would recommend that you watch this repository so that you can get notified of updates and releases.

## Customisations
We expect customers to ammend their configurations to point to Stylitics specific accounts and products.

There are also integrations in the your front end application which you would adopt as a normal Stylitics integration which may include but would not be limited to:

- CSS overrides
- Analytics implementaton
- Event tracking / overrides
- Custom configuration properties
